It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. 

KJV Proverbs, Chapter 12
24. The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.

26. The righteous is more excellent than his neigbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.

28. In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no deth.
