WISDOM and FOOLISHNESS

I twas the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness. 

Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child. But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 

KJV Proverbs, 
Chapter 1
5. A wise man will hear, and will increasse learning, and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
6. To understand a proverb, and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their dark sayingd.
(Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance, to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.)

Chapter 3
13. Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
14. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
15. She (wisdom) is more precious than rubies: and all things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
16. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.
17. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 
18. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
